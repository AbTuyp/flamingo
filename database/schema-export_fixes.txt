The Hibernate schema export tool creates unique constraints on ordered 
collections which conflict with Hibernate changing these collections, so these
should be removed. Remove the following unique constraints from the create table
statements.

category_children (child)
category_services (service)
feature_source_feature_types (feature_type)
layer_children (child)
feature_type_attributes (attribute_descriptor)
level_children (child)
level_layers (layer)
application_layer_attributes (attribute_)
